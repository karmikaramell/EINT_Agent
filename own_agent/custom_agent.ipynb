      "You see a fridge. The fridge contains a raw purple potato, a red onion, a raw pork chop, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a carrot and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato and a yellow bell pepper. Classic TextWorld. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.\n",

      "You see a fridge. The fridge contains a red onion, a raw pork chop, a red hot pepper, a white onion, a carrot and an orange bell pepper. You can see a closed oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh well You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a yellow bell pepper and a raw purple potato. Classic TextWorld. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Sometimes, just sometimes, TextWorld can just be the worst.\n",
